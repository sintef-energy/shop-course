They are either a single instance of the primitive datatypes string, integer and double or an array of these (string is actually a list of characters but will be treated as a primited datatype in pySHOP).

The examples below shows how to create simple `pandas.Series`. The pandas objects also have a convenient built-in plotting function to visualize the data with the index along the x-axis and the value along the y-axis:"

In other words, the missing values are replaced by the first previously known value. This is the most widely used data type in SHOP and is used for both time series of floats and integers, such as flags. It is used for both input and output data.\n",
